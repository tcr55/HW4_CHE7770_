# HW4_CHE7770_

---------------------------------
# Inside this folder are four Matlab files, an excel file, and a PDF of the written work
 * run.m
 * Balances.m
 * Balances2.m
 * Balances3.m
 * HW4.xlsx
 * Written.PDf
 # Written
 This file holds all of the derivation in part 3, written equations for part 3, and solving for hald max and hill coeffiencts in question 1, the explinations for question 2, and the discussion for question 4 
 # Excel
 For the Part 1 the excell has all of the linear data fits and hald max values and solver for maximisizing x to prove its maximum
 # Matlab
 For part 4 the matlab code all will run from the four matlab codes provided, the main run file called run.m will run and produce 2 graphs, the first graph is the original ODE solver graph, and the second graph (Figure2) is an inversion of the X values to try to match the Activity the paper used (ligand should decrease activity, in the un inverted version ours has an error where ligand increases E1 activity which is opposite of the paper). 
 --------------------------------------------------
 There are three plots per figure, where the first plot will talk about the original data at a set ligand, the second plot on the figure will have the ligand concentration changed from L = 0.1 to now L = 1.0.
 --------------------------------------------------
 Lastly the third plot on the figure will show how removing the inhibition power or B on the system will affect the Steady state value.
